	<h1 class="text-info">This website is made to propose to my partner, Isabelle.<br /><i>I want her to live her life with me.</i><br />
	<img src="static/images/Family with Uke.jpg" alt="Raelyn's first birthday"><br />
	She and I have a beautiful daughter, Raelyn. Whenever I'm not here in Cambridge I'm home in Colorado with them. We spend our time hiking, camping, cooking, coloring, and going to parks. We have adventures.<br />

	Isabelle loves to take pictures and finds that she never have enough space; I wanted to fix that. I wanted to make a way for my partner to be able to store her pictures from her phone without needing some special service or adapter or computer. So I made this website.

	<h2 class="text-info">We love the movie UP, and recording our adventures is her hobby. We can add more adventures here, uploading images and whatever files we might like, and download them later. Just like Ellie's book, these are the adventures to come.<br /><br /> In the end, I hope Isabelle knows how much I love her. She is the object of my love. She fills my heart. All time with her is better than any time away. Isabelle is my closest friend, my deepest confidant, my sincerest partner, my lifelong lover. Isabelle is my soul mate. I want to ask her<br /><i><strong>Will you live your life with me?</strong></i></h2>
