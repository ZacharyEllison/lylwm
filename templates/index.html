	<h1 class="text-info">I made this website for you, Isabelle.<br /><i>I want to live my life with you</i><br />
	<img src="static/images/Family with Uke.jpg" alt="Raelyn's first birthday"><br />
	We have our beautiful daughter, and an amazing life ahead of us. We go on so many adventures; hiking, camping, cooking, coloring, going to parks -- and years of Adventures to come.<br />

	You once said Rae is the most documented baby alive. Your phone runs out of space, and soon your flash-drive will too. I want to fix that. I made a way for you to be able to store those pictures from your phone without some special service or adapter or computer. This website is for you.

	<h2 class="text-info">We can add more adventures here, upload images and whatever files we might like, and download them later. This website will grow as we fill it with our Adventures to come.<br /><br /> I hope you know how much I love you. <br />You are the object of my love. You fill my heart. <br />All time with you is better than any time away, I dream of your company,<br /> I hear your voice in the wind. <br />Isabelle you are my closest friend, <br />my deepest confidant, <br />my sincerest partner, <br />my lifelong lover. <br />You have my heart. My soul is yours. I want to ask you,<br /><i><strong>Will you live your life with me?</strong></i></h2>
