The core of the design and the center of my frustrations was the database method. MongoDB runs on it's own database server that you can host on your own. I did and will when I transfer this to a raspberry PI. The program is currently running on the cloud host python anwhere at willyou.liveyourlifewith.me . The images in Index are taken from Unsplash except for my spirit animal donkey. The program utilizes flask framework for uploads and downloads. Uploads are sent to a folder within the same folder as application.py, because it write elsewhere. The download function has to be returned and not just referenced, and it sends the file as an attachment because otherwise the html won't know how to configure the file for download. The explore table is just a table that reads through what's in the database. Possible areas for expansion are a file view page, where images could be viewed.
